# This is my personal website, but you can still contribute!
I try to keep a snapshot of the beliefs/ideas/understandings I talk about most often on this site for easy sharing, but writing one up doesn't trigger (much) extra research so the error rate is high.

**This is bait. I want you to teach me things.**

I think [Cunningham's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ward_Cunningham#:~:text=first%20wiki%20site.-,%22Cunningham%27s%20Law%22) is the internet's best feature, and giving myself license to post half-baked ideas 10x's my output online, so if you see something you disagree with please open an issue!
