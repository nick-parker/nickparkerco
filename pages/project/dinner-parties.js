            Before the pandemic, I hosted dinner parties every couple months with my friend <a href="https://twitter.com/coffeechatsam">Sam Kramer</a> in NYC. 
            They were usually 20-40 people and we tried to invite disparate friend groups, friends of friends, and interesting strangers to encourage new connections.
            Specifically, I tried to game the invite list so nobody knew more than a quarter of the attendees, and I think the vibes were greatly improved by my scheming.
            I cooked the main course and Sam's girlfriend (now wife!) <a href="https://www.instagram.com/onehungrybaker/">Ariela</a> (a CIA trained pastry chef!) usually made dessert.
            <br/><br/>
            I started this tradition at Cornell <span className="italic">mostly</span> as an excuse to show off my cooking, and it grew into one of the most
            wonderful parts of my life. If you're based in Montreal, NYC, or SF and interested in reviving this vibe with me please<a href="https://twitter.com/NickParkerPrint">drop me a line</a> :)
