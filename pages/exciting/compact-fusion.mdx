Teams around the world are trying to build _compact_ nuclear fusion reactors. I'm in love with this
mission for largely aesthetic reasons. I don't think we need fusion power to mitigate climate change, nor
do I think we should bet much on it in that arena. However, if we want to escape "fusion is always 20 years
away" small reactors that you can iterate fast on feel right to me. This [article](https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/29074/skunk-works-exotic-fusion-reactor-program-moves-forward-with-larger-more-powerful-design) says
Lockheed Martin's Skunkworks has already built five iterations of their reactor. We formally agreed to build
ITER - the crown jewel of the "make them bigger" approach - in 2006, and it won't be ready to test until 2025.


For me, fusion power is romantic-verging-on-quixotic because it's not the solution\[[1]\] to our current problems: It's the
key to new kinds of magic.

[Merchant marine nuclear power](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_marine_propulsion#Merchant_ships) has been a non-starter since we dropped the first bomb. Fission meltdowns, nuclear proliferation, and decommissioning are scary problems and we don't need giant ships badly enough to solve them. But, if Lockheed Martin _actually delivers_ a fusion power plant in a shipping container, that completely flips the economics of shipping. I can't tell you what this looks like but I can tell you it's awesome. Maybe we'll see mind-bogglingly massive ships traveling at about the same speed. Maybe we'll sacrifice energy efficiency for higher speed [hydrofoils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofoil) or [wingships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ground-1effect_vehicle) to deliver faster and amortize the capital cost of the ship over more trips.

Maybe we'll ditch ships entirely and fusion powered aircraft that dwarf the [AN-225](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya) will take over
all cargo service. Atomic Accidents by James Mahaffey has a great section on a 1950s [project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear-powered_aircraft#NEPA_and_ANP) which tried to pull this off with early fission.

# **General Fusion**

I don't know who's going to pull this off, or when anyone will, but for aesthetic reasons [General Fusion](https://generalfusion.com/technology-magnetized-target-fusion/) is my favorite contender. Their approach is satisfyingly physical: pistons, pressure, and a whirlpool of molten metal. I can viscerally imagine groaning about some tedious problem with my _fusion reactor_ like a bad carburetor on an old car. As I understand it, the three big issues for fusion reactors are 

1) Squeezing hydrogen plasma hard and hot enough that the atoms fuse together, 

2) Safely capturing the heat of that fusion to do work (thermonukes are not power plants)

3) Keeping the flood of neutrons released from [destroying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_radiation#Effects_on_materials) every material in the reactor.

General Fusion is building a sphere of molten lead and lithium a few meters in diameter and using pumps to spin the metal so a siphon
forms along its vertical axis. Hydrogen plasma is shot into the siphon, and pistons arrayed across the outer surface of the spherical
chamber rapidly push in more molten lead. The additional metal crushes the central siphon to 1/1000th its original volume and adiabatic 
compression of the hydrogen plasma takes it to other-worldly temperatures\[[2]\]. The plasma fuses during the crush and blasts
the inner wall of molten metal with intense heat and neutron flux. The siphon grows again and the whole process repeats.

Here's the beautiful bit: Extracting heat and getting useful reactor lifetimes in spite of neutron damage are
fairly open problems for most approaches. General Fusion has a thick layer of molten lead between the fusion and the nearest solid
surface, so the neutrons just turn into extra heat\[[3]\]. They're also already pumping that lead through a loop to establish their
siphon, so adding a heat exchanger to make steam and run boring conventional turbines is dead simple. 

There are asterisks on this: Making plasma stable enough to endure the time between injection and squeezing is hard but they say they've
done that. The [magnetohydrodynamics](https://xkcd.com/1851/) of the spinning, shrinking internal surface of the molten metal
are [difficult to predict](https://generalfusion.com/2018/11/modeling-highly-unsteady-current-driven-liquid-metal-free-surface-mhd-flows/). But, the whole system makes sense. You can visualize it, and you can imagine
a future where it's banal.

## **Footnotes**

### \[1\]
If we actually got compact fusion working tomorrow it'd solve a _lot_ of problems, when I say solution here I mean
"safest satisficing solution." Fusion's pay-off curve is a huge swath of nothing, a narrow band of "oh yeah that fixed a
few things but has limitations" and then utopia. I'm more comfortable betting most of the house on stuff like solar,
where we know every marginal unit of effort has positive and increasing impact.

### \[2\]
It surprises me that fusion can occur at pressures compatible with physical pistons, and a physical pressure vessel for that matter.
The lead is incompressible so the entire surface of the vessel and the head of each piston sees the same pressure as the _fusion reaction_.
Fusion in stars like our sun happens at an absurd 250 billion times atmospheric pressure. It turns out we _totally can't achieve that_ and
all our fusion plans revolve around temperatures far hotter than the core of the sun and paltry pressures. The record plasma pressure was set
by [Alcator C-Mod](https://www.psfc.mit.edu/news/2016/pressure-record-faq#q_4_6) and it's just over 2 atmospheres. I'm
not sure plasma pressure is the same as "how hard it pushes against a tangible surface" but it seems to be.

### \[3\]
This is a bit of a hand-wave. The lead absorbs the neutrons, turning into other isotopes of lead and releasing EM radiation in the process.
You can go through the [list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isotopes_of_lead) of isotopes yourself to follow that process - each time a lead atom absorbs a neutron
its atomic weight increases by 1. The nice thing about lead is the overwhelming majority of lead atoms are 206, 207, and 208, which are all
stable. 209 is terrifyingly violently unstable with a half-life of 3 hours, but it decays into Bismuth-209 which is effectively
stable with a halflife of 10^19 years. 210 is actually bad with a 22 year halflife and worrying decay products, but you only get
it in "double captures" where a 208 atom first captures a neutron to become 209, and then captures a _second_ neutron in the handful
of hours before it decays to Bismuth. Even lead-210 has a halflife of 22 years and all its decay products are less than half a year, so within
a single lifetime almost all your lead-210 will turn back into stable lead-206. This is why General Fusion says they'll produce "no long lived waste."

The other interesting bit related to neutron capture is [tritrium breeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeding_blanket) which General
Fusion plans to achieve by mixing molten lithium into their molten lead. This will also improve the capture cross section of the mixture, further
protecting the solid components from neutron damage.
